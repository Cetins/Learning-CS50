# Learning-CS50
Please check README before forking into project :)

This is my final project for CS50 2019
This project will be open source once it's submitted to the CS50.

All final projects should be genuine.
You can benefit the codes as in technical level but please do not use the ideas, custom functions and design-wise decisions in this project until I submit the project.
But also please consider I'm still learning, the snippets you would extract will be more experimental and far from expert :)

All my projects are free to mess or contribute but as this project is my final task to complete my course, I would kindly ask you not to fix or correct anything :)
Feel free to clone and play with the code on your computer.
It's all ok as long as you are not using it publicly.

Please check Harvards academic honesty video in the link below for more information about code sharing during CS50:
